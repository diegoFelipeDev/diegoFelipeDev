### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**diegoFelipeDev/diegoFelipeDev** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on pessoal projects; 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning reactjs and english;
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on with the github community;
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with experience to my first job;
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git and people management;
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-felipe-da-silva-b21289206/;
- âš¡ Fun fact: I use all the settings for everything in English, even though I don't know the language yet lol.
